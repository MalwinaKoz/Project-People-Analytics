# Project People Analytics

## Project description
The project was initiated as a coursework assignment in a Data Mining class. Its purpose is to develop our skills in the field of artificial intelligence, with a particular focus on machine learning, teamwork, and using the GitHub platform. The data for the project was collected through a survey about the competencies of the members of the WAIT – Wrocław AI Team. 

## Business context
The aim of this project is to develop an algorithm that will enable the most accurate grouping of people based on their qualifications. This algorithm will then be used to identify individuals who are best suited to the requirements of a given project, thereby optimizing the process of creating project teams.

## Problem to be solved
The project aims to simplify the process of finding the most qualified individuals for appropriate roles in project teams. This qualification is supposed to be based on the algorithm we created and trained. 

## Machine Learning Method
The algorithm will use a machine learning method called clustering. This method involves grouping a set of objects in such a way that the objects belonging to the same group (cluster) are more similar to each other (according to specified criteria) than to objects in other groups (clusters).

## Our goal
The ultimate goal of this project is to be able to create simple and easy to read groups of our objects abilities. This will allow us to group people by advancment level and it will show us natural "circles" of "teachers" that want to or are able to share their knowledge and "students", which means people that want want to further hone and expand their skill repertoire.

## Our results

### Data preprocessing
We take our raw data to clean and preprare it for the analysis. 

##### Looking for missing values
First of all we are looking for incomplete data records. Some people cold miss a question or decided they do not want to answer it.
