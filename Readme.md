## Project description
The project was initiated as a coursework assignment in a Data Mining class. Its purpose is to develop our skills in the field of artificial intelligence, with a particular focus on machine learning, teamwork, and using the GitHub platform. The data for the project was collected through a survey about the competencies of the members of the WAIT ‚Äì Wroc≈Çaw AI Team.

## Business context
The aim of this project is to develop an algorithm that will enable the most accurate grouping of people based on their qualifications. This algorithm will then be used to identify individuals who are best suited to the requirements of a given project, thereby optimizing the process of creating project teams.

## Problem to be solved
The project aims to simplify the process of finding the most qualified individuals for appropriate roles in project teams, based on their skills as identified in previously completed surveys.

## Machine Learning Method
Algorytm bƒôdzie korzysta≈Ç z metody uczenia maszynowego zwanej klasteryzacjƒÖ. Metoda ta polega na grupowaniu zbioru obiekt√≥w w taki spos√≥b, aby obiekty nale≈ºƒÖce do tej samej grupy (klastra) by≈Çy bardziej do siebie podobne (wed≈Çug okre≈õlonych kryteri√≥w) ni≈º obiekty nale≈ºƒÖce do innych grup (klastr√≥w).
